    "content": "Monday, 28 Oct 2024 PUTRAJAYA: The proposed Gig Workers’ Economy Bill set to be tabled this December will push for 24-hour social security coverage, says Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi (pic). He said the Bill will be tabled after the Budget 2025 is passed. Ahmad Zahid, who is also the chair of the Supreme Committee on the Establishment of the Malaysian Gig Economy Commission, said this to the media after the closing ceremony of the Malaysia Madani Gig Economy Convention on Monday (Oct 28). The convention, attended by about 800 gig workers, was organised by Akademi Kenegaraan Malaysia and the Workers' Unions and Gig Economy Secretariat. Ahmad Zahid said that the 24-hour social security coverage was requested by the gig workers themselves. \"This is because they are currently between the ages of 19 and 34 years old. As they grow older, they fear not being able to get necessary medical treatment, which would be unfortunate. As a developing country, we should ensure that gig workers receive the same benefits as employed workers,\" he said. Ahmad Zahid added that the proposed Gig Workers’ Economy Act will be tabled in the current Parliament session after Budget 2025 is passed. He said that the Human Resources Ministry will table the Bill to be passed in Dewan Rakyat and then take it to the Dewan Negara for approval. \"The main elements of the Bill will include a safety net for gig workers, and protection should not be merely in the form of the Employees Provident Fund, but also from the Social Security Organisation (Socso),\" said Ahmad Zahid. \"I have requested that medical costs for gig workers be covered even though this may have a high financial implication. We should show our concern and discuss this further with the Human Resources Ministry, Finance Ministry, and the Secretariat,\" he added. Ahmad Zahid then said that all of this will be included in the Bill after discussions with universities, especially Universiti Malaya, which has provided consultation on the proposed Act. He added that although there are other Acts for workers, there is a need for one specialised for gig workers. \"However, the application of the proposed Gig Workers’ Act should not sideline the existing Acts for employees. The proposed Act will be specific to the development of the gig economy,\" said Ahmad Zahid. Earlier at the event, Ahmad Zahid said upskilling and reskilling of gig workers are needed to ensure they can find permanent employment. Workers' Unions and Gig Economy Secretariat chairman Datuk Seri Mohd Sharkar Shamsudin said there is an urgent need for the Malaysian Gig Economy Commission, known as SEGiM, to be effective. \"The gig economy comprises part-timers and freelancers in addition to e-hailing and p-hailing workers. \"For now, there is no single authority overseeing these gig workers, and there is an urgent need to ensure the financial security of their incomes,\" said Mohd Sharkar.
