    "description": "PUTRAJAYA: The proposed Gig Workers’ Economy Bill set to be tabled this December will push for 24-hour social security coverage, says Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. Read full story",
    "content": "Monday, 28 Oct 2024 PUTRAJAYA: The proposed Gig Workers’ Economy Bill set to be tabled this December will push for 24-hour social security coverage, says Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi (pic). He said the Bill will be tabled after the Budget 2025 is passed. Ahmad Zahid, who is also the chair of the Supreme Committee on the Establishment of the Malaysian Gig Economy Commission, said this to the media after the closing ceremony of the Malaysia Madani Gig Economy Convention on Monday (Oct 28). The convention, attended by about 800 gig workers, was organised by Akademi Kenegaraan Malaysia and the Workers' Unions and Gig Economy Secretariat. Ahmad Zahid said that the 24-hour social security coverage was requested by the gig workers themselves. \"This is because they are currently between the ages of 19 and 34 years old. As they grow older, they fear not being able to get necessary medical treatment, which would be unfortunate. As a developing country, we should ensure that gig workers receive the same benefits as employed workers,\" he said. Ahmad Zahid added that the proposed Gig Workers’ Economy Act will be tabled in the current Parliament session after Budget 2025 is passed. He said that the Human Resources Ministry will table the Bill to be passed in Dewan Rakyat and then take it to the Dewan Negara for approval. \"The main elements of the Bill will include a safety net for gig workers, and protection should not be merely in the form of the Employees Provident Fund, but also from the Social Security Organisation (Socso),\" said Ahmad Zahid. \"I have requested that medical costs for gig workers be covered even though this may have a high financial implication. We should show our concern and discuss this further with the Human Resources Ministry, Finance Ministry, and the Secretariat,\" he added. Ahmad Zahid then said that all of this will be included in the Bill after discussions with universities, especially Universiti Malaya, which has provided consultation on the proposed Act. He added that although there are other Acts for workers, there is a need for one specialised for gig workers. \"However, the application of the proposed Gig Workers’ Act should not sideline the existing Acts for employees. The proposed Act will be specific to the development of the gig economy,\" said Ahmad Zahid. Earlier at the event, Ahmad Zahid said upskilling and reskilling of gig workers are needed to ensure they can find permanent employment. Workers' Unions and Gig Economy Secretariat chairman Datuk Seri Mohd Sharkar Shamsudin said there is an urgent need for the Malaysian Gig Economy Commission, known as SEGiM, to be effective. \"The gig economy comprises part-timers and freelancers in addition to e-hailing and p-hailing workers. \"For now, there is no single authority overseeing these gig workers, and there is an urgent need to ensure the financial security of their incomes,\" said Mohd Sharkar.

    "content": "The Malaysian government has a strategic vision to propel the country into the top 20 global startup ecosystem index by 2030. Microsoft's recent $2.2 billion investment and Nvidia's collaboration with ytl ? valued at 20 billion ring ? signify a positive direction in reaching this goal. The K20 Summit 2024, spearheaded by Economy Minister Rafizi Ramley, is key to attracting high-quality investors to the country; the initiative will provide support for capital, talent, and startup-quality enhancement in Malaysia.\n\nThe K20 action plan is inspired by Ireland's successful attraction of major tech companies such as Google and Apple, primarily through a combination of talent incentives and low corporate tax, not forgetting that Dublin is known as \"Silicon Docks?. While Malaysia does not intend to replicate Ireland's strategy exactly, it aims to play to its own strengths, specifically in the sectors of semiconductors, clean energy, agriculture technology and Islamic fintech.\n\nPrime Minister Anoiar Ibrahim has released the K20 action paper which maps the necessary reforms to unite key stakeholders such as venture capitalists and incubators with the tech start-up sector. The paper outlines a new single window initiative to expedite approvals, and cut bureaucratic red tape thereby facilitating start-ups and drawing more investors. This would simultaneously create opportunities for venture capitalists, through access to funding from institutional investors, visa fee exemptions, and quickened license approval for fund setups.\n\nThe initiatives may take around a decade to materialize into significant benefits but steps are being taken to commence these processes as soon as possible. The focus of these plans revolves around boosting income, generating significant economic spin-offs, and utilizing the competitive advantages of Malaysia. The aim is not simply to emulate models like Silicon Valley, rather to develop their own unique start-up environment attracting high potential start-ups and tech companies.",

Data provided by Bloomberg show that the Ringgit has appreciated 14.35% over the past 3 months, outperforming gold's rise of 14.2%.\n\nAnalyst Lloyd Chan of MUFG Bank, credits this appreciation to Malaysia's economic growth and the US Federal Reserve's ongoing interest rate easing cycle. Other factors contributing to this recovery include an improved outlook for revenue-generating sectors such as tourism, and rising global gold prices.\n\nAnalysts expect the Ringgit to continue its positive trajectory, potentially reaching a five-year record high of four Ringgit to the US dollar by year-end. This projection is contingent upon favorable market sentiment towards Asian currencies and the US Federal Reserve board slashing its interest rate by 50 basis points on September 27th. \n\nBMI Country Risk and Industry Research revised the Ringgit's end 2024 forecast to four Ringgit per US dollar, projecting further strengthening in 2025. Demand for the Ringgit is anticipated to remain robust, bolstered by narrowing interest rate differentials and improving trade performance, providing a potential window of opportunity for investment. \n\nThat being said, it is essential to maintain vigilance as variables such as changes in international trade relations or domestic economic policy could disrupt this positive trend.",

    "description": "Kuala Lumpur: Concerns rise as Malaysians spend RM130 million in southern Thailand, potentially impacting currency stability",
    "content": "Summary of News Transcript:\n\nEconomists warn of potential economic risks following a recent trend of Malaysians spending large sums of money abroad, specifically 130 million Ringgit in southern Thailand. Concerns have been raised over the possible weakening of the local Ringgit currency, as the outflow of funds and conversion to foreign currencies could cause a rise in supply, leading to depreciation. \n\nThis has potential implications for the broader economy, as a weaker ringgit can lead to higher import costs and may induce inflationary pressures. This sort of external spending also diverts resources and potential growth from the local economy.\n\nGolem Tha from the University of Malaya, and Ahmed Rasman Abdul Latif from Autra Business School, both recommend rectifying this situation by incentivizing Foreign tourists to spend in Malaysia, and encouraging home-grown spending. This would help direct funds back into the local economy, with beneficial impacts on business growth, productivity, and job creation.\n\nRisk Assessment:\nThe significant outflow of funds could potentially depreciate the Ringgit, leading to inflation and economic instability. Encouraging spending within Malaysia should be prioritized to disable any potential unfavorable economic impacts.\n \nOpportunity for Investment:\nThe current situation suggests that initiatives aiming to boost tourism and attract foreign spending could be particularly lucrative. Such strategies would not only stimulate the national economy but might also offer profitable investment opportunities with potentially high returns.",

    "description": "Kuala Lumpur: Market analysts upgrade Malaysia's rating following successful subsidy cuts and governance reforms",
    "content": "Malaysia's economy has seen a positive turn in recent times, leading to an upgrade in its rating by market analysts. This is due to a series of policy reforms, infrastructure development, and investment centered on digital data. One key factor is the government's bold steps in cutting subsidies, which despite its sensitivity, has proven to be effective and meaningful.\n\nThe Malaysian government offered cash incentives to its citizens in bid to ease the transition from subsidies, with two-wheel vehicle owners receiving ringgit 5200. Funds saved from cutting subsidies are redirected towards productive use in the economy, such as literacy programs, reskilling efforts, and progressive wage policies.\n\nThe administration's response to the 1MDB scandal has contributed to a governance reset in the country. Numerous policies and reforms have been passed to ensure growth does not compromise fiscal consolidation. These actions have worked to change perceptions about Malaysia: foreign investors are starting to take interest in the region again after a period of significant outflows.\n\nFurthermore, Malaysia is increasingly being recognized as a technology-centric nation with multiple sector opportunities for investment. Industries such as data centers, electric vehicles, and green energy have shown significant growth potentials. Hence, while foregn ownership is currently only 19%, it's expected to rise given the various economic and investment opportunities. \n\nOverall, the steady GDP growth of 4.2% in the first quarter of the year, along with the earnings growth tracking a 10-11% mark, indicate a favorable environment for investment in Malaysia. The government aims to achieve a consistent 5% growth rate in the future.",

    "content": "Malaysia's economy experienced an 18-month high quarterly expansion in Q2, growing 5.9% YoY, exceeding the previous quarter's growth of 4.2%, and surpassing the government's advanced estimate of 5.8%. Strong household spending, higher tourist receipts, and a rise in exports and investments drove the growth. Encouraged by employee provident fund withdrawals, cash handouts, and festive spending, household spending saw a sharp increase. \n\nInvestment activities surged to 11.5% YoY, propelled by infrastructure projects such as the job Baru Singapore Rapid Transit System, the East Coast Rail Line, and the Pan Borneo Highway. Favoring these developments, Bank Negara, the central bank, predicts growth to be at the higher end of its 4 to 5% estimate for the year, albeit subject to both upside and downside risks. \n\nDespite an inflation uptick post diesel subsidy cuts in June, the bank anticipates inflation to stay manageable, ranging between 2 to 3.5% this year. The Malaysian Ringgit, after hitting a 26-year trough against the US dollar in February, has recuperated, appreciating by 3.3% YTD. \n\nKey Takeaways:\n1.

    "description": "Putrajaya: Government introduces service tax hike and new taxation measures to manage 1.5 trillion ringgit national debt",
    "content": "Based on news transcripts, the Malaysian government has been allocating a large chunk of its budget towards operating expenditure (OPEX), covering expenditure including civil servant wages, pension, subsidies, maintenance of government buildings, and interest payments on national debt. Malaysia's national debt presently stands at 1.5 trillion ringgit, leaving limited reserves for development needs.\n\nTo address this, the government has implemented several measures to boost revenue, including increasing service tax from 6% to 8% and introducing new taxes like low value goods tax and capital gains tax. However, this strategy might exacerbate financial conditions if the income levels of Malaysians stay stagnant. Hence, it's crucial to simultaneously raise Malaysians' income levels, which have hovered around 11,000 USD per year for the past ten years.\n\nThe government is looking to increase productivity, create high-skilled jobs, and improve wages to complement the revenue generated from additional taxes. Additionally, subsidies are being rationalized to optimize savings ? an aspect that a central database, Padu, will help with by ensuring subsidies reach deserved recipients.\n\nThe government is also focusing on curbing corruption and fiscal leakages to prevent the misuse of public funds. Several initiatives have thus been taken to steer the country's fiscal trajectory and optimize finances for developmental purposes. However, implementation of these measures faces obstacles such as public acceptance and political will.\n\nIn short, for an SME considering investments in Malaysia, this suggests opportunities in sectors that can offer higher productivity and wages alongside potential business uncertainties due to policy shifts and tax increases. Additionally, stricter regulatory measures imply an increase in compliance requirements. Overall, while there are indications of economic overhaul in Malaysia, certain policy risks associated with these financial transformations need to be considered.",
